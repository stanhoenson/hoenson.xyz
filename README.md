# hoenson.xyz

My personal website. 

It's in between a **private journal** and a **professional portfolio**.
This is the one-stop spot to find *all* my work.

## How it's built

It's built with the amazing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.
I've designed the theme myself and the website uses fonts by [Connary Fagen](https://connary.com/).
