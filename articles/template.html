                            This is a new website and it's really cool.
                            However, it's not like a "modern" website, it looks rather old actually.
                            Well, this is how <strong>I</strong> prefer to see the web: minimal and concise.
                            This reduces digital pollution and, for me, is just way more pleasant to navigate.
