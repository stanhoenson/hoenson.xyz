                <h2>What I'm currently up to</h2>
                <p>
                    Becoming the best version of myself.
                    I'm improving my skills and learning new things.
                    I'm working on my health and I'm reading a lot.
                    Finally, I'm quitting the vices that are holding me back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be able to take care of myself and my loved ones.
                    I believe life in first world countries is <strong>way</strong> too comfortable and it's making us weak.
                    I don't want to become complacent, so I won't.

                <h2>Creating this website</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been handcoding this website.
                    I'll soon post an article detailing on why I'm handcoding it.
                    Quick summary: <em>to learn as much as possible</em>.

                <h2>Finishing school</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm in my final year of university and the last thing to do is an intership and write a thesis.
                    I've found a company and I'll be starting in November.
                </p>

                <h2>Working as a postman</h2>
                <p>
                    Since my internship starts in November I've decided to work a side job.
                    I've been a postman in the past and I actually enjoyed it a lot.
                    I like being outside and embracing the different - and sometimes "extreme" - weather conditions.
                    Also, people are really friendly to postmen.
                    So, currently, I'm a postman.

                <h2>Doing The Odin Project</h2>
                <p>
                    The Odin Project is a free and open source web development curriculum.
                    My skills are a bit lacking since I never really cared that much.
                    I'm doing this to better my fundamentals and to build some projects.
                    I do like programming and see it as a great skill to have.
