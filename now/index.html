                    <h2>What I'm currently up to</h2>
                    <p>
                        Becoming the best version of myself.
                        I'm improving my skills and learning new things.
                        I'm working on my health and I'm reading a lot.
                        Finally, I'm quitting the vices that are holding me back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to be able to take care of myself and my loved ones.
                        I believe life in first world countries is way too comfortable and we're taking it for granted.
                        I don't want to become complacent, so I won't.

                    <h2>Creating this website</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've been handcoding this website.
                        I'll soon post an article detailing on why I'm handcoding it.
                        Quick summary: to learn as much as possible.

                    <h2>Finishing school</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm in my final year of university and the last thing to do is an intership and write a thesis.
                        I've found a company and I'll be starting in November.

                    <h2>Working as a postman</h2>
                    <p>
                       Since my internship starts in November I've decided to work a side job.
                       I've been a postman in the past and I actually really liked it.
                       I like being outside and embracing the different - and sometimes extreme - weahter conditions.
                       Also, people are really friendly to postmen.
                       So I'm currently a postman.

                    <h2>Doing The Odin Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Odin Project is a free and open source web development curriculum.
                        My skills are a bit lacking since I never really cared that much.
                        I'm doing this to better my fundamentals and to build some projects.
                        I do like programming and see it as a great skill to have.
