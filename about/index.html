                        This is a new website and it's really cool.
                        However, it's not like a "modern" website, it looks rather old actually.
                        Well, this is how <strong>I</strong> prefer to see the web: minimal and concise.
                        This reduces digital pollution and, for me, is just way more pleasant to navigate.
