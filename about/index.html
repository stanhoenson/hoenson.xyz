                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Stan, I'm 23 years old, I live in the Netherlands and I enjoy many things.
                    I like the arts (especially music), I like the sciences, I like philosophy and religion.
                    Generally speaking, I like a good balance between pragmatism and idealism.
                    <em>Please don't set aside your morals for money</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like frugality and not taking more than needed.
                    I like honesty and transparency.
                    I like freedom of speech.
                    I think it's important to be able to discuss openly and still be able to be friends while having disagreements.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I like optimism, but not to the detriment of realism.
                    In general, facts over feelings.
                    I like comedy and people not taking themselves to seriously.
                    <em>Relax a little and have some fun</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But most importantly, I like <strong>peace</strong>.
                    All this heated polarity is heartbreaking.
                    We're in this together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost forgot to mention:
                    I'm a student of Software Engineering and I'm in my final year.
                    So it seems like my career will be in software!
                    Also, I make electronic music.

                <h2>Quick history</h2>
                <p>
                    The fastsest way to describe my life would be: gaming.
                    I've been an avid gamer since I was around four years old.
                    It has always been my most defining characteristic.
                    I was <strong>the gamer</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And, I became really good at it.
                    Any game that you play against other people I had to be good at.
                    I derived all my status from my performance in gaming...
                </p>
                <p>
                    But don't get me wrong, I also played for fun.
                    I've met awesome people online and have had lots of great times.
                    I've played many amazing games and some of them mean a lot to me.
                </p>
                <h3>Some of my favorite games</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cuphead</li>
                    <li>UNDERTALE</li>
                    <li>Overwatch</li>
                    <li>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</li>
                    <li>Mario Kart 8</li>
                    <li>Hades</li>
                    <li>Celeste</li>
                    <li>Hyper Light Drifter</li>
                    <li>Shovel Knight</li>
                    <li>And many, many more...</li>
                </ul>
                <img

                <p>
                    Even though gaming was a big part of my life, I also did other stuff.
                    I'm pretty social and have always had great friends to hang around with.
                    I played football for many years and really enjoyed having fun with my teammates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    School, however, has always been a bit of a struggle for me.
                    Not that I found it hard, I just found it <strong>hugely</strong> unsatisfying.
                    Even university to this date is not really satisfying to me.
                    It's not intrinsincally rewarding to me.
                    I prefer self-study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And just like everyone: I've had my ups and downs.

                <h2>How I got into music</h2>
                <p>
                    As already mentioned, I adore music and I even make music myself.
                    My father has been a musician in the past and he always hoped I wanted to learn an instrument as well.
                    Unfortunately, I wasn't interested in music as a young kid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first music I enjoyed as a kid was by Michael Jackson.
                    I became a big fan and collected basically all of his albums.
                    Apart from that I adored The Beatles' Yellow Submarine movie soundtrack.
                </p>
                <img 
                    src="../images/yellow-submarine.jpg"
                    alt="The Beatles' Yellow Submarine"
                    width="700px"
                    height="auto">
                <p>
                    When Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the big game, I got introduced to electronic music through 'quick scope' montages.
                    <em>I was instantly in love</em>.
                    It was something new and had an amazing energy.
                    This is how I became fond of 'drum and bass' and dubstep.
                    StanSB and Skrillex where my favorite artists at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An online friend of mine did music production and introduced me to it and the SoundCloud underground producer scene.
                    This is where I got introduced to many great artists like Herzeloyde, Sam Gellaitry and many more.
                    It was incredibly inspiring and I got more and more into music production and started "releasing" music as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/colorglitch">Color Glitch</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my "roots" are in electronic music, which is already incredibly varied, I love <strong>many</strong> different styles of music.
                    It's very hard to describe my music taste and ten songs wouldn't be enough to demonstrate it.
                    Naming genres I enjoy is also not enough.
                    Noone ever likes all songs in a particular genre.
                    Also, there are <strong>major</strong> misconceptions of what a genre actually sounds like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To give a bit of an idea though, here are some lists of music I enjoy.
                </p>
                <h3>Well known artists I enjoy quite a bit</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Daft Punk</li>
                    <li>Michael Jackson</li>
                    <li>Tyler, The Creator</li>
                    <li>Jacob Collier</li>
                    <li>Disclosure</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The above might give you an idea of what I like, but the list below is even more important to me.
                    Both lists lack a dubstep artist though, my favorites in dubstep are Space Laces and HOL!.
                </p>
                <h3>My absolute top 10 artists</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Quickly, quickly</li>
                    <li>Tennyson</li>
                    <li>Bickle</li>
                    <li>underscores</li>
                    <li>Noisia</li>
                    <li>Billboard</li>
                    <li>Anomalie</li>
                    <li>Sam Gellaitry</li>
                    <li>Duskus</li>
                    <li>Herzeloyde</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    There are so many more artists that are awesome and I plan on doing many articles about music, highlighting great artists or albums.
