On this page you can find the **tools** and **software** that I use for my work.

I like to keep things **minimal** and **simple**.
Apart from that, I focus on **high quality** tools that are **durable** and **fun to use**.

## Writing

Generally, I prefer **writing** over **typing**.
These are the tools I use for physical writing.
