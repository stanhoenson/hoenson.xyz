Hi, I’m a Dutch guy interested in **writing**, **computing**, **music** and much more.
I’m 24 years old and almost finished with my bachelor in Software Engineering.

## Now

My main objective as of now is **finishing college**.
I really want to be done with school so I can start my career.
School has been a struggle and I'm sure I'll feel **especially relieved** when I'm done.

Apart from finishing college, I'm focusing on the following things:

- Building **this website**, and all that comes with that.
- Getting better at **writing**.
- Forming **strong habits** for **physical** and **mental** health.

## About this website

This website serves as a place for me to share my work (and hopefully inspire other people as well).
I want it to be in between a **private journal** and a **professional portfolio**.
Not too personal, not too formal. Just the right balance of quality **and** quantity.

You can read more on **how** it's built [here](../hoenson).
