## Backstory

I am incredibly proud of this one, it honestly brings tears to my eyes.
For now, this is my **magnum opus**.
The stars truly aligned on this one.

The song was meant to be a collaboration and get released on a compilation album.
There was a deadline and I started working hard on sending some ideas to my collaborator.

He liked it, but had a hard time adding more to it.
I continued working on it because of the deadline.
A few weeks of flow and it was basically finished.
I've never finished a song this fast.
I love the result, I'm feeling ecstatic.

The compilation got **cancelled**.

Well, that's a bummer.
I'll just release it on my own then!

It became a success, at least for an underground SoundCloud song.
I never expected this kind of response.
