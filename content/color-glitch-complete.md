The title says it all.
This is a showcase of all my **worthwile** music I've made over the past 8 years of **on and off** production.

It contains many different genres of electronic music and even some demo's where I sing, yikes.

You could see this mix as my **musical resume** from 2014 to 2022.

(I used a SoundCloud embed for this one because it's a huge file and I'd like my website to remain low in size.)
