This website serves as a place for me to share my work (and hopefully inspire other people as well).
I want it to be in between a **private journal** and a **professional portfolio**.
Not too personal, not too formal.
Just the right balance of quality *and* quantity.

## On this website

- I'll be writing [essays](/writing/essays) and [notes](/writing/notes).
- I'll be making [programs](/computing/programs) and [websites](/computing/websites).
- And, I'll be creating [songs](/music/songs) and little [demos](/music/demos).

Apart from that you can learn more [about me](/about) or harshly judge my [resume](/about/resume).
