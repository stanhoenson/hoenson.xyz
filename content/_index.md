## Welcome!
The purpose of this website is for me to have a central place for sharing my work and who I am. 
I want to get better at certain crafts and try new things. 
This website will serve as the place for me to practice.

At first, I want to prioritise quantity a bit more than quality.
I'll take it 'somewhat' seriously, so I will curate what I do and don't put out.
I want it to be in between a journal and a professional portfolio. 
Anyways, enjoy!
