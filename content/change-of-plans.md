I wanted to use *just* this website for **all** my endeavours.
One place for everything I do.
During the creation of this website, I struggled with keeping it simple and easily understandable.
When designing this website I went through many designs.
The one you're seeing right now is in my opinion the best one.
It looks clean and it's pretty simple.
But it might be a bit **too** simple.

## Too simple?

I want to write about music I like.
I want to write about producing music.
I want a place to share my music.
I want a place to share my project files, samples and presets.
I want a place for **anything** music.

I want to write about technology I like.
I want to write about learning web design and programming.
I want to write about many different topics related to technology.
I want a place to share my programs and applications and document the making of them.
I want a place for **anything** technology.

I want to write about books I've read.
I want to write about learning writing.
I want to write about relearning cursive writing.
I want to write poets.
I want a place to share a book someday.
I want a place for **anything** writing.

I want to write about everyday life.
So about health, philosophy and spirituality.
I want to write about little ideas I have.
I want to write about life experiences and what I learnt from them.
I want a place to be a bit more like a journal.
I want a place for **anything** "life"-related.

I love **simplicity**.
It wouldn't be simplistic to have all the above on one singular website.
It would become cluttered, convoluted and confusing.
It would be a design nightmare.

So, I think all of these would work better as there own website and have their own visual identity.
If someone is only interested in technology, he or she can just stay on that website.

Apart from that, I really enjoyed the designing (and creation) of this website and would like to get even more experience with designing and using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It seems like a good idea for myself and for any potential future readers.

## The process

I'm gonna use this website for documenting the creation of all the different websites.
I'll write about using Hugo, creating the designs and organizing the content for the websites.
I'll share my struggles and I'll share what I've learned.
