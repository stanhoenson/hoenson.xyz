A little drum and bass demo.
I've been playing around with [Rift](https://www.minimal.audio/products/rift), which is an incredible distortion plugin.

Both the bass and melody lead use Rift.
On the melody I've used it to create a really expansive atmosphere.
Just these two instruments create the whole song, apart from the drums of course.

You can do a lot with a little.
