Shield Frog is a **cute** house song with a **froggy** melody.
Imagine the melody being sung by the frog in the cover art, it might make you chuckle.

## Backstory

This song is nostalgic to me.

It reminds me of the times where I was part of a *very* underground producer scene on SoundCloud.
I talked a lot with these people on Discord and I can fondly remember most of them.
Also, it was the first song where I started to get a **decent** grip on producing.

I used this song for applying to a music college, and &mdash; after I got in &mdash; we listened to this song in class.
An absolute **nerve-racking** experience.

(I find it really uncomfortable to listen to my music with other people, you don't even understand.)

That experience aside, I had a great time at the music college and met lots of awesome people.

Shield Frog reminds me of all the above.

Nowadays though, this song is a **half-meme**.
