Do **not** sleep on Louis Cole.

## Quality Over Opinion

Louis Cole's latest album 'Quality Over Opinion' came out last friday.
On my first listen I loved it.
On my second listen I loved it even more.
On my third listen I knew this will be my **album of the year**.
(Which says a lot, since many great albums came out this year.)

It's hard to even start talking about this album.
It just has it all.
Every song is emotional.
Some provoke happiness.
Some provoke sadness.
Some provoke anger.
Some provoke anxiety.
And some provoke a feeling of love and romance.

The album is also multi-dimensional while still being very much cohesive. 
Some songs are fast and funky.
Like *I'm Tight* and *Dead Inside Shuffle*.
Some songs are slow and lush.
Like *Disappear* and *Let it Happen*.

The production on the album is great.
It's not necessarily clean, it just has **character**.
His synth work is awesome.
Either very funky or straight up mesmerizing, like the synth on *Laughing in Her Sleep*.
The use of strings and horns is awesome.
His drums sound really cool, a bit muffled, but obviously done intentionally.
Somehow that gives more room for his voice to shine.
He has this unique highpitched airy voice that just fits his songs like a glove.
And not to forget the guitars, including bass.
So many **mega funky** basslines.

His lyrics are lighthearted, but still very thoughtful.
At first glance he might come across as goofy, but if you look into it more deeply I think you'll come to a different realization.
He seems **anxious**, **insecure**, **depressed**, **aimless** and **nihilistic**.
It also seems his heart is broken and he misses a girl.

However, the album itself is not depressing at all.
As I said, it provokes many different emotions.
And there are just a few songs that could provoke sadness.
For me, *Disappear* and *Let it Happen* triggered some tears.
(His song *Things* from his previous album still triggers tears occasionally to this day.)
But I've also smiled and even laughed during the album. 
Again, this album **does it all**.
At least for me.

I love pretty much all songs on this album, so I won't list my favorites.
Instead I'll list the ones I think could be enjoyed by most people.
I would recommend to listen to the **full** album, but if you don't feel like it, start with the ones below:

## Some of his other works

Quality Over Opinion is my favorite work of his, however, he has made some **amazing** songs before.
His previous album 'Time' is great as well.
My favorite songs of that album are the following:

- [Weird Part Of The Night (Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgPZmSwC4M)
- [When You're Ugly (Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS4NxiURhEw)
- [Freaky Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfiyTTP3WRw)
- And most importantly, [Things (Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhllQAiEQlM)

*Things* is one of my favorite songs of all times.
No words for it.

Apart from that he has some incredibly fun live performance songs.
These also have video's, be sure to check them out.
