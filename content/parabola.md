I've been wanting to start singing in my music for a while.
However, my style doesn't really fit vocals.
Or at least not **my** vocals.

I've also been wanting to make more "poppy" songs.
This demo is a result of both of these desires.

I can see this style going somewhere awesome.
And it's also really fun to make.
