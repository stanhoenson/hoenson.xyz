## Backstory

After making Underwater Disco, all I did was playing Overwatch (and college).
This game might just be my favorite game of all time.
It felt like it was made **specifically** for me.
I got really good at it and stopped making music for a long time...

When talking about what I truly want from life, music is always a part of that answer.
The only normal reaction would be to get back into producing.
I did.

I lost a bit of my skills and had a rough time finding my sound again.
I remembered I made [Underwater Disco](../underwater-disco/) under a deadline and tried doing that again.

It worked, though when it was "finished" I decided to give it some more time.
I got feedback from a professional producer on stream and from my good friend [Dauwpunt](https://soundcloud.com/dauwpunt).
I worked on it more, and I'm glad I did.

It has turned out pretty good.
And, Dauwpunt released it through his label so it's available on pretty much all streaming platforms.
