I like the **small web**, the **UNIX philosophy** and **FOSS** (Free and Open Source Software).
I want to contribute to the world of computing using those concepts as my compass.

(There are some cool programs coming!)

- Programs are **small tools** with a focus on **extensibility**. 
- Websites are **informational** first and **aesthetic** second, both are important.
