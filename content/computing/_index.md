I like technology, but not the way it's headed.
I prefer the **small web**, the **UNIX philosophy** and **FOSS** (Free and Open Source Software).
Those concepts are my main compass in computing.

- Programs are **small tools** with a focus on **extensibility**. 
- Websites are **informational** first and **aesthetic** second.
