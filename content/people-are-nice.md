## A rainy morning

I wake up early to my sunrise emulating light setup.
I faintly hear it's **raining** outside.
What a pleasant sound.
I brush my teeth, scrape my tongue, wash my face and go downstairs.
Every morning I drink a big glass and when it's nice out, I do this in fresh air.
Today though &mdash; as I already knew &mdash; it was raining.

You know these weird people who like the rain?
Well, I'm one of those **weirdos**.

The intention is to go for a morning walk every single day, but this week, I've been slacking.
This rain though is inviting me to go for a walk.

It was a **blissful** walk.

Completely grey skies, a soft rain on my face and not many people outside.
Except for the dogwalkers and runners of course.
The dogs always bring a smile to my face.

I come back home, do some coding on **this very website** and get ready for work.
I put on a different pair of shoes, because those I wore during my morning walk were wet.
I'm ready to get out of the door, but then I realised I forgot to put on my rain trousers.

The shoes I was wearing take a long time to put off and on, so I decided to not use the rain trousers.
It wasn't really raining at that very moment anyway.

Bad decision.

## Postman Stan

I've been postman for a year in, I believe, 2016.
It was a good experience.
You're outside, you move, you build mental strength because of &mdash; occasional &mdash; harsh weather conditions, and last but not least, **people are really nice** to you.

So this year I decided to become a postman again until I start my internship.
Postman Stan is back.

But today, postman Stan is fighting against the rain, without any rain trousers on.

Luckily it wasn't cold at all.
The only "problem" I face when it's raining is that it's difficult to change gears on my carrier cycle.
I fixed this by putting a microfiber cloth on the gear shifter.
Apart from that it just was a **pretty normal workday** with some added water droplets from heaven.
Normal load, my usual colleagues and the same neighbourhood that's completely turned upside down because of construction which makes every day a new puzzle.
So truly, a normal day.

Until I hear someone yelling "POSTMAN"...
Usually when this happens I delivered the wrong mail to the wrong house.
Or some grumpy old people get mad at me for some silly reason.
But today, it was a lady offering me some coffee.
Because it's raining outside, she told me.
And because it looked cold.
Though it wasn't, in my experience.

What a nice surprise.
I gracefully accept the coffee.
For the rest of the day I'm just thinking about *how nice people actually are*.

On the internet &mdash; where I spent more of my time then I shoud &mdash; it often seems we all hate each other.
But in the "real world" people generally are friendly.

I remind myself that people are always so friendly to me as a postman.
Everyone greets me with a smile.
And in the summer on some particularly hot days, a man gave me cold soda.
Although I don't drink soda normally, for him I made an exception.
Because I felt so grateful.

But even while I'm not delivering mail **people are nice**.
During walks, most people greet each other warmly.
At school, teachers and staff are very helpful.
At my internships, colleagues are interested and humorous.
At festivals everyone is...
Well, at festivals people are just dancing to music, but the atmosphere is always cordial.

And not to forget friends and family.
They are always there for me when I need them most.
I'm grateful to have some amazing people in my life.

The lesson of today is simple.
Don't get sucked up into the internet too much.
Relax, and get out in the real world.
**People are nice**.

Or, at least most of them.
